# Overview
This is a first attempt at creating a repo for rust code. I am in
the process of teaching myself rust, starting from hello world...
The book I am using is "Command-Line Rust ISBN 978-1-098-10943-1"

The codeComment repo will be updated with how I comment Rust Code
once I figure out more of the language. From what I gather, it is
memory safe C with some different syntax, macros, and "cargos" in
place of libraries! Having worked in C, I expect to pick this up,
all things going well.
